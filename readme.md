This is the Calculator project from The Odin Project. 

Challenges:
- The hardest part was getting calculator flow to work. I used an object as the calculator memory, 
and modified values depending on input. When I got this right, modifying
functions went without any major issues. 

- Using event listeners for keys, and separating numbers, operators
and the decimal key.

Areas to practice:
- Arrow functions, need to fully understand the logic. Many functions in the 
code could probably be a lot more condensed.
- CSS for different size displays. I made the calculator fixed size, which means
it will not scale depending on viewport. 
- Condensing CSS - the style sheet is way too long for such a simple project.

Areas to revisit:
- Listeners to keyboard presses. 
- Active states on the operator buttons to highlight
the active operator. 
- The css should be reworked to scale depending on display.
